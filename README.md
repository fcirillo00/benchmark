# benchmark
Little program I made to test CPUs.

It executes a multi-threaded prime factorization of a range of numbers.
The final result is the number of factorizations successfully completed.
CPU usage reaches 100% during the benchmark.

### Note:
To compile on <b>Windows</b> you need a MinGW compiler with pthread support.
